# Interpolation (and extrapolation)
These scripts are the result of implementing some interesting algorithms shown
at the math lectures of my university.

One of the algorithms implemented is the
[Newton polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_polynomial), with a
well-documented code.

Another extrapolation algorithm uses a difference tree (not only a difference
actually, since it can also use division and arbitrary operators) to guess
the next value. The site from which we found this can be checked
[here](http://alteredqualia.com/visualization/hn/sequence/).
